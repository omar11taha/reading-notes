# Functions
We must first know the difference between **Expressions and operators**, and then we will learn about *Functions*
## Operators :The operator has many symbols that help in producing results in an easy, fast and easy way, and these are some of them:
*Assignment operators (x &&= y,x >>= y,x -= y,....)
*Comparison operators(Equal (==),Less than or equal (<=),.....)
*Bitwise operators(a | b,a >> b,....)
*Logical operators(expr1 && expr2,!expr,....)

## Now we will talk about types of Functions:
1. *Defining functions*:A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

*The name of the function.
*A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
*The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
2. *Function expressions* :Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name
