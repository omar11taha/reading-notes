# Node. js
<!-- from online -->
Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. ... js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node. js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node>
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.
Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.
NPM is a node package manager. It is basically used for managing dependencies of various server side dependencies. We can manages our server side dependencies manually as well but once our project's dependencies grow it becomes difficult to install and manage.

Node. js:v10.19.0

  js in 2009. Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.





## Pair Programming
6 Reasons for Pair Programming:
  1. Greater efficiency
  2. Engaged collaboration
  3.Learning from fellow students
  4. Social skills
  5. Job interview readiness
  6. Work environment readiness

  Greater efficiency:
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
