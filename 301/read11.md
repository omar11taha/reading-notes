# SQL&NoSQL
| | SQL | 	NoSQL | 
| -----| ----- | ------ |
| Data Storage Model | Tables with fixed rows and column | JSON documents, Key-value: key-value pairs | 
| Development History | Developed in the 1970s with a focus on reducing data duplication |Developed in the late 2000s with a focus on scaling  |
|  Primary Purpose| General purpose |  general purpose, Key-value: large amounts of data with simple lookup queries |
| Schemas |Rigid|Flexible|
|Scaling  | Vertical (scale-up with a larger server) | Horizontal (scale-out across commodity servers) |


## sql vs nosql
1. SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
2. A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database.
3. The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.
4. js-schema is a new way of describing object schemas in JavaScript. It has a clean and simple syntax, and it is capable of serializing to/from the popular JSON Schema format. The typical use case is declarative object validation.
5. NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases.
6. JavaScript is what is called a Client-side Scripting Language. ... When the browser loads the page, the browser has a built-in interpreter that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and runs it. Web page designers use JavaScript in many different ways. One of the most common is to do field validation in a form.
7. MongoDB provides the following commands, methods, and operator that perform server-side execution of JavaScript code: ... $where operator that evaluates a JavaScript expression or a function in order to query for documents.
8. While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.
9. Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
