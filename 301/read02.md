# React
<!-- from onlin -->
Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.
static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps
## The constructor for a React:
 component is called before it is mounted.If the component is a subclass you should call super(props), or the props will be undefined. constructors can be used to assign state using this.state or to bind event handle methods to an instance. Letâ€™s take a look at some example code.
### the order that happen:
1. render
2. componentDidMount
3. constructor
4. componentWillUnmount
5. React Updates

## React State Vs Props
**props**:its like an arguments to a function
we can change props to another one
props pass into a component
we can use it in order to make it dynamic
**state** handled inside of the component
and its updated inside the component
and we can re-render our application
we can use it for example in counter.
