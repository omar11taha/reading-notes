## Women Stopped Coding
1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.
Movies like Weird Science, Revenge of the Nerds and War Games all came out in the '80s. And the plot summaries are almost interchangeable: awkward geek boy genius uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and win the girl.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
Facebook publishes an annual diversity report—a way to catalog the efforts the company is making toward diversifying its staff, and to report on its progress. They’re not alone; many other companies, both in the technology world and beyond, are implementing similar initiatives. And yet each year, the results seem underwhelming.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are more important now than ever, and we all need to do better. To assist, CustomInsight is offering our new DEI employee survey FREE of charge. It includes research-based survey questions, normative benchmarks, and an interactive dashboard that will clarify your workplace culture climate and identify opportunities for improvement.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa?
For 87% of organizations around the globe, diversity has become either a stated value or priority area for their companies. 
But apart from being just a percentage, it’s essential to dig a little deeper to see what benefits having a diverse customer service team brings to the table. A study found that inclusive companies are 1.7 times more likely to be innovation leaders in their field. Furthermore, diverse companies are as much as 35% more likely to outperform their competitors.
