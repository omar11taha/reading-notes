# loops
In order to be able to make code and some commands, we need to know some things, namely:
## Expressions and operators:
An **expression** is a combination of one or more operands, zero or more operators, and zero or more pairs of parentheses.
The **operators** indicate what action or operation to perform.
### Here are some operators:
1. *Assignment*
2. *Addition assignment*
3. *Subtraction assignment*
4. *Multiplication assignment*
### There are two forms of loops who and we will learn about them and their work:

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
* for :The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates
* while : If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
