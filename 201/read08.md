# css
As we know, css gives formatting to the web page that we create, and one of its advantages is that it controls the color of the font, its shape, the background color, the place of writing, the size that the element reserves, and many more features, and we will look at some of them.
1. position:
* static 
* relative 
* absolute
* fixed
* z-index
(They all control the place of writing in relation to a specific reference)

2. float:We can move a paragraph to any place we want, for example to the left of the page

To browse websites, we can use our phone or laptop, so the display method can change, and in order not to differ with us too much, we try not to put a pixel, but rather a percentage of the screen size in our format
