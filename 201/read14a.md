## 2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

2D Rotate
The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how you can change this default point of rotation.
2D Scale
Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to.
2D Translate
The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

As with the scale value, to set both the x and y axis values at once, use the translate value and declare the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.

The distance values used within the translate value may be any general length measurement, most commonly pixels or percentages. Positive values will push an element down and to the right of its default position while negative values will pull an element up and to the left of its default position.
## 3D Transforms
Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

3D Rotate
So far we’ve discussed how to rotate an object either clockwise or counterclockwise on a flat plane. With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally. Using the rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically. Lastly, using the rotateZ value allows an element to be rotated around the z axis.
Backface Visibility
When working with three-dimensional transforms, elements will occasionally be transformed in a way that causes them to face away from the screen. This may be caused by setting the rotateY(180deg) value for example. By default these elements are shown from the back. So if you prefer not to see these elements at all, set the backface-visibility property to hidden, and you will hide the element whenever it is facing away from the screen.
## Transitions
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.
