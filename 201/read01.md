## html&css&js
We study html & css & js to design websites. We must initially study several things before designing the website: we must know what the site is, the form that it should have, and the best format to be suitable for the people who use it, and after it is well coordinated, we start building the site (as It is the case when you build a house that you draw a blueprint to see how it will look and what is your best option to be comfortable for its users).
They are programs for designing a web page, which is a language that enables us to deal with the computer in the language it understands.
