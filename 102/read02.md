# GIT
**Git** *is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed* 

 ## The local Git repository has three components:

1.Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2.Index: The area used for staging
3.Head: Points to the most recent commit

The Life Cycle of File Status
After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
You stage the modified file.
Then, you commit staged changes.

After using these commands, files are tracked and staged for committing.

After adding a new file called EXAMPLE, you would see information regarding changes to be committed when using the git status command.

After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes and record what you did within the commit message.
