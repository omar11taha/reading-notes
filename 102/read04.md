# JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class 
functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 
JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, `dynamic language`, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (*e.g. functional programming*) **styles**. Read more about JavaScript.
In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser 
APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages. 
As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable.
There are many elements that we use in JavaScript and we will review some of them:
1. greeting: function()
2. alert()
3. const objectName = ("")
4.person.bio()
