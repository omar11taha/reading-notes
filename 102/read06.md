*CSS* `Cascading Style Sheets` allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.
*There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
1. External CSS:An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.
2. Internal CSS:An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
3. Inline CSS:To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
